            <p class="infoParagraph">
            Kaitiakitanga is a Maori concept which refers to the guardianship and protection of the environment and its natural resources. Kaitiakitanga is linked to plastic pollution as it emphasizes the responsibility of individuals and communities to care for the environment, including reducing plastic waste and its impact on ecosystems.<br>
            By embracing Kaitiakitanga, individuals and communities can contribute to the preservation of the environment and combat plastic pollution. This involves not only personal actions but also advocating for policies and practices that promote sustainability and reduce plastic waste. <br>
            In summary, Kaitiakitanga is a guiding principle that encourages responsible stewardship of the environment, including addressing the challenges posed by plastic pollution. It calls for collective action to protect natural resources and ensure a sustainable future for all.<br>
