            <p class="infoParagraph">
            Kaitiakitanga is a Maori concept, meaning the guardianship or protection of the environment for future generations. <br>
            The idea of Kaitiakitanga focuses on caring for the land, sea and all other living things, ensuring that they are 
            preserved for the future generations to come. <br> The way we follow Kaitiakitanga is respecting nature and 
            using our resources wisely, maintaining balance. It is known in Maori culture that their people are deeply connected 
            to their land, sea, and living things. It is seen as their responsibility to protect it for themselves and their descendants. 
            <br> Kaitiakitanga encourages people to have a sustainable living and is a reminder of our role in protecting our environment. 
            as we are not seperate from it.
